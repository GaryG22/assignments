    <h2 class = "intro"> Introduction </h2>
    <p class = "introP">Welcome to my profile! My name is Gary Gritsch. Growing up I’ve always been interested in software development and understanding the way programs operate. 
        I would spend a great deal of time understanding and getting familiar with technology and the fast developing world around us has never made this easy. 
        But that’s exactly why I love it! My passion for learning and dedication to developing new skills has made me into the person I am today.</p></div>

    <h2 class = "challenge"> Challenging Myself </h2>
    <p class="text"> I've always loved challenging myself and find this to be the best experience in becoming familiar with understanding my strengths and weaknesses. 
        The challenge mixed with my love for this country is what brought me to join the United States Marine Corps when I graduated high school. Over the last three and a half years the skills I have developed through relentless studying and vigorous training exercises have taught me a lot about myself and life skills that I can apply to every software development role.
         Over the last year I have been working two jobs and pursuing my dream of becoming a Full-Stack software developer through V School.</p>

    <h2 class = "adversity2"> Adversity & Persistence </h2>
    <p class="text2"> Overcoming adversity is an essential skill. This has taught me to face difficult tasks confidently and not be afraid to fail a few times. This is the heart of software development and utilizing critical thinking abilities to find solutions. I have also learned plenty of leadership skills utilized as a Team-leader, and Squad-leader being in charge of four to sixteen marines. 
        Not just being in charge of their training and learning but also their work life balance, because individual readiness doesn’t just come from work. 
        Mastering a craft takes Persistence and that is exactly what makes any great athlete, musician, or in my case software developer become proficient at what they do.</p>

    <h2 class = "key2"> Key To Success </h2>
    <p class="text3"> Self discipline opens you to endless possibilities. Without self discipline, accomplishments and goals would almost be impossible. Self discipline is key to my success and drives me to stand out from others. It is what helped me receive a meritorious promotion to the rank of Corporal in less than two years into my contract and before any of my peers.
         I am always searching for the next challenge. I love being a leader and role model. 
        Driving success for others and myself is what I do best.</p>
